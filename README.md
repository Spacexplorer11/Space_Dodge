This is just a pygame project which I followed a youtube tutorial to make ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waY3LfJhQLY )
I have been adding new features such as sound effects, lives and I will try to add a level system!
This project is currently in active development and I am just doing it as a hobby.


Instructions to use the game: 
The instructions to play the game are in-game.
First, you must download python from https://python.org.
Make sure it is correct for your computer

Secondly, open the terminal on your computer and type the following one after another:
pip install pygame,
pip install simpleaudio

If pip install simpleaudio doesn't work use, pip install https://github.com/hamiltron/py-simple-audio/tree/master.
