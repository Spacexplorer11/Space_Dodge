# Space Dodge

A game where you dodge bullets that are coming down from the top of the screen. It can only be played with a keyboard.

## Description

This is just a pygame project which I followed a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waY3LfJhQLY) to make.  
I have been adding new features such as sound effects, and lives and will try to add any suggestions!  
Please leave them in [Issues under the "suggestion" tag](https://github.com/Spacexplorer11/Space_Dodge/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).

>[!Note]  
> This project **is** currently in **active development**, I work on it during my free time.  
> Any help would be **greatly appreciated!**  
> Do **not** hesitate to open a pull request. I will review it as fast as possible (1-3 days).  
> If you need help opening a pull request, please follow [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) or watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCKdihvneS0).

## Instructions to use the game

The instructions to play the game are in-game.

>[!Important]
> **Are you on Windows?**  
> If you are on Windows, you will need to run `python` in terminal/command prompt on its own and download Python from the Microsoft store as well as from the website.

1. Download Python from [python.org](https://python.org). **Make sure it is correct for your computer.**
>[!Caution]
 >Make sure it is the **official** [python site](https://python.org)!
2. Download the zip file from the main page of the repository. [Click the green `Code` button and click `Download Zip`](https://github.com/Spacexplorer11/Space_Dodge/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
3. Extract/unzip the file to a desired location.
4. Open the terminal on your computer and navigate to the extracted folder.
5. Type: `pip install pygame` to install pygame. You also need to do `pip install pygame_widgets`.
6. In the extracted folder, find `main.py`, and run this file.  
You can also right-click it, click `copy path`, go to terminal/command prompt and type `python PATH`. Replace `PATH` with the path to the file.   
The game should start, but if you have **any** trouble, [create an issue with the tag "help wanted"](https://github.com/Spacexplorer11/Space_Dodge/issues/new?template=help_wanted.yml).
>[!Tip]
>You should try opening the `main.py` file in the default `IDLE`, and provide a screenshot of the error message when you run it in the `IDLE`, as this will severely help me solve the issue faster.
