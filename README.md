## Description

This is just a pygame project which I followed a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waY3LfJhQLY) to
make.  
I have been adding new features such as sound effects, and lives and will try to add any suggestions!  
Please leave them in [Issues under the "suggestion" tag](https://github.com/Spacexplorer11/Space_Dodge/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).
If you have **any** feedback please fill out this [survey](https://tally.so/r/mOo7pA)


## Instructions to install the game

The instructions to play the game are in-game.
1. Download Python from [python.org](https://python.org). **Make sure it is correct for your computer.**
> [!Caution]
> Make sure it is the **official** python site (https://python.org)!

> [!Important]
> If you are on windows, please run `python` on its own in the terminal/command prompt and install python from the microsoft store as well
2. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/spacexplorer11/Space_Dodge/releases/latest/download/Space_Dodge.zip)
3. Extract/unzip the file to a desired location.
4. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files. Find main.py (it is inside the space_dodge folder)
>[!Note]
> The script will automatically create a venv (virtual environment) in the same folder as the main.py file.
> This avoids breaking system Python or relying on global packages.
5. Right click it and open with python (launcher) not IDLE or run the command `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` (depending on your OS) to start the game.
> [!Note]
> It may take a few seconds to open the game, as it is installing necessary packages, so please be patient.


## What to do if anything goes wrong?
You should [create an issue](https://github.com/Spacexplorer11/Space_Dodge/issues/new?template=help_wanted.yml) and make sure to upload the mylog.log file if available. Make sure to upload screenshots or screen recordings of **any** errors. Thanks!
> [!Tip]
> If you can't find the mylog.log file, then
> you should try opening the `main.py` file in the default `IDLE` (right click `main.py` and open with python IDLE), and provide a screenshot of the error message when
> you run it in the `IDLE`, as this will severely help me solve the issue faster.

## FAQ
- Q: Why does the game freeze when I drag the window?
- A: Unfortunately, this is an **operating system bug** which pauses the main thread when you drag the window, causing the game to freeze.
