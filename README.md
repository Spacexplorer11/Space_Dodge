This is just a pygame project which I followed a [YouTube tutorial]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waY3LfJhQLY) to make.    
I have been adding new features such as sound effects, and lives and will try to add any suggestions!  
Please leave them in Issues under the "suggestion" tag.  
  
>[!Note]
This project is currently in active development, I work on it during my free time.  
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
