# Space Dodge

A game where you dodge bullets that are coming down from the top of the screen. Can only be played with keyboard.

## Description

This is just a pygame project which I followed a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waY3LfJhQLY) to make.  
I have been adding new features such as sound effects, and lives and will try to add any suggestions!  
Please leave them in [Issues under the "suggestion" tag](https://github.com/Spacexplorer11/Space_Dodge/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).
