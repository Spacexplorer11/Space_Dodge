# Space Dodge

A game where you dodge bullets that are coming down from the top of the screen. It can only be played with a keyboard.

## Description

This is just a pygame project which I followed a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waY3LfJhQLY) to make.  
I have been adding new features such as sound effects, and lives and will try to add any suggestions!

## Instructions to use the game

The instructions to play the game are in-game.

>[!Important]
> **Are you on Windows?**  
> If you are on Windows, you will need to run `python` in terminal/command prompt on its own and download Python from the Microsoft store before proceeding.

1. Download Python from [python.org](https://python.org). **Make sure it is correct for your computer.**
2. Download the zip file from the main page of the repository. [Click the green `Code` button and click `Download Zip`](https://github.com/Spacexplorer11/Space_Dodge/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
3. Extract/unzip the file to a desired location.
4. Open the terminal on your computer and navigate to the extracted folder.
5. Type: `pip install -r PATH/requirement.txt` to install the necessary dependencies. Replace `PATH` with the path to requirements.txt. You will find it in the extracted folder. 
6. In the extracted folder, find `main.py`, and run this file.  
You can also right-click it, click `copy path`, go to terminal/command prompt and type `python3 PATH`. Replace `PATH` with the path to the file.   
The game should start, but if you have **any** trouble, [create an issue with the tag "help wanted"](https://github.com/Spacexplorer11/Space_Dodge/issues/new?template=help_wanted.yml).
