This is just a pygame project which I followed a youtube tutorial to make ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waY3LfJhQLY )
I have been adding new features such as sound effects, lives and I will try to add a level system!
This project is currently in active development and I am just doing it as a hobby.
