<p>
This website collects <strong>minimal, anonymous data</strong> to help prevent abuse and manage server load.
</p>

<h3>What is collected</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Your browser’s <strong>User-Agent</strong> (e.g. browser + device type)</li>
  <li>Your <strong>IP address</strong> (used only for anti-spam detection)</li>
  <li>The time you visited certain pages</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>
To detect spam or abuse (like bots hitting the site too often), and to balance traffic so things don’t break.
</p>

<h3>Your Privacy is Respected</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This site does <strong>not</strong> use tracking cookies.</li>
  <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect any personal information (like your name, email, etc.).</li>
  <li>There are <strong>no ads</strong> or third-party analytics services watching you.</li>
  <li>However, we use local storage to temporarily save non-personal data like our GitHub stats to improve performance.
	  This data never leaves your device and is deleted when you close the tab.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
Your data is not shared with anyone and is only stored in temporary memory on our server. It is <strong>never</strong> logged permanently.
	However, if we detect abuse through our systems, your IP may be stored to allow us to block you from using our services.
	This is only in extreme situations, and we will not share this information with anyone.
