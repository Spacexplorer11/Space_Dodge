<header><h1>About Space Dodge <br><br></h1></header>
<p>Space Dodge is a simple singleplayer game made by <a href="https://github.com/spacexplorer11">Akaalroop Singh.</a>
	The original concept is from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waY3LfJhQLY">youtube tutorial.</a>
	However, every single feature after that was hand-coded by me and my <a href="/contributors">contributors.</a>

<div class="header"><h2>Why did I make it?</h2></div>
<p>Space Dodge was made a project to assist my skills in python! I wanted to start doing more text-based
	programming rather than scratch's block based. I wanted to start with a game, as a fun way to boost my motivation to
	code as well!
	I followed the 45 minute tutorial but I felt I wanted more, more of a challenge, so I continued on, adding more
	features and making new things.
	I also vowed to never use ai in this project because ai doesn't really help you learn the code and feels wrong to
	use as well. </p>

<div class="header"><h2>How long did it take?</h2></div>
<p>As mentioned before, Space Dodge was just a side project, something to boost my learning, but soon became my true
	passion and main project.
	I can't provide an exact time, however an estimate would be around 100ish hours. I know I've spent 30+ hours on the
	website alone, and the game has been my focus for longer
	so the total time must easily exceed 100 hours.</p>

<div class="header"><h2>What is the future of Space Dodge?</h2></div>
<p>Space Dodge is a project I want to continue, however I am getting involved with more and more projects, such as my
	recent <a href="https://github.com/Spacexplorer11/Meow_Meals">Meow Meals</a>,
	I haven't been able to spend as much time as I would like on Space Dodge, but I have plenty of more ideas planned
	for it! Whenever I feel like coding,
	and I haven't gotten an active project with a deadline, I work on Space Dodge, my first ever passion project ❤️</p>
